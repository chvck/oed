Putting the old OED online

The Oxford English Dictionary is the most detailed dictionary of English, and an incredible resource.

The first edition is out of copyright. This means we can legally adapt it forthe web.

The hard work is already done: scans of almost all volumes exist on the Internet Archive.  But they're hidden away, and inaccessible.

So let's build a better interface to them.
